## Members:
- Logan Buchanan
- Ioana Sandor
- Taylor Wilkinson
- Robert Michels

## Deadline:
November 27 @ 11:59pm

## Project Deliverables:
- Report detailing your team design process detailing these three waves: 
- Wave 1: design for human perceptual, cognitive, and motor performance Did the design process take human capabilities and limitations into account? Were established Wave 1 methods used to define human abilities and to confirm that the design was highly usable for its users?
- Wave 2: design for societal and organizational rules, processes and values Did the design process take rules, ethics, and organizational/social considerations into account. Were established Wave 2 methods used to define the social and organizational contexts in which the design would be used and to confirm that it will integrate in those processes?
- Wave 3: design for user experience Did the design processes show evidence of advanced design thinking and design craft (e.g. ideation, etc.) for the design of the graphical interface? 15pts Wave 4: Integrative HCI How was information about the usability, context, and UX design integrated in the overall design process? Were tradeoffs identified, and if so, how were they dealt with?
- The application or interactive site
- Code and images used in implementing the project
- Peer review of process and contributions of team members (may used to allocate group marks to individual team members)

## Grading Rubric:
- Design for human capabilities. Did the design process take human capabilities and limitations into account? Were established Wave 1 methods used to define human abilities and to confirm that the design was highly usable for its users?
- This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Wave 2: design for societal and organizational rules, processes and values. Did the design process take rules, ethics, and organizational/social considerations into account. Were established Wave 2 methods used to define the social and organizational contexts in which the design would be used and to confirm that it will integrate in those processes?
- This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Wave 3: design for user experience. Did the design processes show evidence of advanced design thinking and design craft (e.g. ideation, etc.) for the design of the graphical interface?
- This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Wave 4: Integrative HCI. How was information about the usability, context, and UX design integrated in the overall design process? Were tradeoffs identified, and if so, how were they dealt with?
